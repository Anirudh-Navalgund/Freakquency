Instead of looking for online websites slapping you with stupid-ass ads to download songs to your device for offline listening, just run this little python script for hassle-free song downloading!

**Note:** Run these 3 commands in your IDE terminal to install the dependencies necessary for the python script to work
- `pip install spotdl`
- `pip install customtkinter`
- `spotdl --download-ffmpeg`
  
Thank me later :)ðŸ©·
