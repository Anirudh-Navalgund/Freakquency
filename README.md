# Freakquency
Instead of wasting time on shady websites filled with annoying ads to download songs, just run this simple Python script â€” paste your Spotify link and enjoy hassle-free offline downloads!

**Note:** Run these 3 commands in your IDE terminal to install the dependencies necessary for the python script to work
- `pip install spotdl`
- `pip install customtkinter`
- `spotdl --download-ffmpeg`
  
Thank me later :)ðŸ©·
